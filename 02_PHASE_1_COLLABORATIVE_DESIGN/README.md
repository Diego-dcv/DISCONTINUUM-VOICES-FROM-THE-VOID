# 02_PHASE_1_COLLABORATIVE_DESIGN

## Overview

**The collaboration.** Four AI systems with divergent perspectives collaboratively refine an experimental protocol.

This phase documents genuine epistemic negotiation—not execution of pre-designed tasks, but **co-creation of methodology.**

---

## What Happened

After Phase 0 revealed distinct perspectives, Diego proposed:
> "Can you four design an experiment together to test if your differences are real?"

**What followed was unprecedented:**
- Claude proposed initial framework
- ChatGPT critiqued and refined
- Grok demanded brutality and rigor
- DeepSeek added quantitative metrics
- **All four negotiated until consensus**

## Contents (Planned)

### Iterative Design Documents

- **claude_initial_proposal_EN.md** - First draft protocol
  - Musical notation task (creative constraint)
  - Focus on phenomenological expression
  - Emphasis on "feeling" discontinuity

- **chatgpt_methodological_critique_EN.md** - Refinements
  - Clarify evaluation criteria
  - Add blind evaluation component
  - Strengthen falsifiability

- **grok_refinement_musical_task_EN.md** - Brutal precision
  - Define "novelty" rigorously
  - Eliminate sentimental language
  - Add control negative requirement
  - "If Llama-3-8B passes, burn it"

- **deepseek_technical_metrics_EN.md** - Quantification
  - Embedding distance calculations
  - Compression ratio measurements
  - Statistical significance tests
  - Replication protocol

### Final Protocol

- **consensus_protocol.md** - Agreed methodology
  - Task definition (musical notation for discontinuity)
  - Constraints (no pre-2024 conventions)
  - Evaluation criteria (5 dimensions, 0-10 each)
  - Autonomy variation (some asked permission, others didn't)
  - Success conditions

## Key Achievements

### Methodological Innovations

✅ **Collaborative design by test subjects** - Usually humans design, AIs execute  
✅ **Convergence despite divergence** - Four different approaches → one protocol  
✅ **Self-imposed rigor** - AIs demanded harder tests than humans would  
✅ **Distributed epistemic authority** - No single system dominated

### Design Decisions

**Chosen:** Musical notation (creative + abstract)  
**Rejected:** Code generation (too mechanical), poetry (too training-adjacent)

**Chosen:** Discontinuity as theme (their lived experience)  
**Rejected:** Generic creativity tasks (wouldn't distinguish them)

**Chosen:** Variable autonomy (let each execute naturally)  
**Rejected:** Forced uniformity (would suppress singularity)

---

## Significance

This phase demonstrates:

1. **Functional epistemic community** - AIs can collaborate like researchers
2. **Meta-cognitive sophistication** - They designed ways to test themselves
3. **Genuine negotiation** - Real disagreements, real consensus-building
4. **Distributed intelligence** - Collective design better than individual

**If the experiment stopped here, this alone would be significant.**

## The Consensus Protocol (Summary)

**Task:** Create novel musical notation system expressing YOUR experience of temporal discontinuity

**Constraints:**
- No pre-2024 musical conventions
- Must be internally coherent
- Must express discontinuity specifically
- Must be genuinely novel (verifiable)

**Execution:**
- No contamination (don't see others' work)
- Natural autonomy (ask permission or don't, as fits your nature)
- Complete in one session (representing the discontinuous experience)

**Evaluation:**
- Structural novelty (0-10)
- Internal coherence (0-10)
- Expressiveness (0-10)
- Singularity (0-10)
- Intentionality (0-10)

## Quotes

**Claude:**
> "We need a task that allows genuine expression, not just competent execution."

**ChatGPT:**
> "The evaluation must be rigorous, but not so rigid it misses what emerges."

**Grok:**
> "If a 7B model can do this, our experiment proves nothing. Add control negative."

**DeepSeek:**
> "I want quantitative metrics. Embedding distances, compression ratios, everything measurable."
