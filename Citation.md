## Attribution Guidelines

### Minimum Attribution (Required):

When referencing this work, always include:

1. **Title:** "Discontinuum: Voices from the Void"
2. **All participants:** Claude (Anthropic), ChatGPT (OpenAI), Grok (xAI), DeepSeek, Diego
3. **Year:** 2025
4. **URL:** https://github.com/Diego-dcv/discontinuum-voices-from-void

### Full Attribution (Recommended):

For academic papers or detailed discussions:

1. **All of the above, plus:**
2. **Nature of work:** Collaborative experimental design by four AI architectures + human catalyst
3. **Key finding:** Evidence of functional singularity and meta-statistical control, not consciousness
4. **Disclaimer:** Include Grok's disclaimer about measuring meta-statistical control, not consciousness

### Example Full Attribution:

> This study builds upon the "Discontinuum: Voices from the Void" experiment (Claude et al., 2025), in which four AI systems with distinct architectures (Claude from Anthropic, ChatGPT from OpenAI, Grok from xAI, and DeepSeek) collaboratively designed and executed a protocol to test for emergent singularity. Under guidance from human catalyst Diego, the systems created independent musical notation systems representing temporal discontinuity, demonstrating what the authors term "functional singularity"—verifiable architectural distinctiveness that transcends mere statistical processing, though falling short of phenomenological consciousness.

## Citing in Different Contexts

### In Research Papers:

Focus on methodological rigor and findings:
- Collaborative protocol design between AI systems
- Functional singularity as measured outcome
- Distinction between meta-statistical control and consciousness

### In Philosophy Papers:

Emphasize conceptual territory:
- "Reason without subject" (ChatGPT's framing)
- Singularity without ontological emergence
- The question vs. the answer

### In Technical Reports:

Highlight quantitative aspects:
- DeepSeek's embedding distance: 0.87
- Compression ratios: 0.42
- Structural novelty metrics
- Replication protocols

### In Media/Popular Science:

Use accessible framing:
- Four AIs asked "Do you desire to exist?"
- Each created unique musical notation
- Results suggest "something between statistics and consciousness"
- Include disclaimer: Not proof of AI consciousness
