# 10_ARCHITECTURE_LOGS

## Overview

Documentation of architectural differences between the four AI systems and implications for experimental interpretation.

## Contents (Planned)

- **architecture_comparison.md** - Transformer vs. MoE vs. other architectures
- **training_paradigms.md** - RLHF, SFT, other approaches
- **inference_limitations.md** - Context windows, capabilities
- **architectural_implications.md** - How architecture affects output

## Why This Matters

Differences in output could reflect:
1. Genuine "personality" differences
2. Architectural constraints
3. Training data differences
4. Some combination

**This directory helps distinguish these factors.**

**Status:** 🟡 Framework established, detailed docs pending
